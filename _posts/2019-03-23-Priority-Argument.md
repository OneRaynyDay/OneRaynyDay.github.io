# Recap

**Quick recap**: previously, we defined _recursive enumerable_ (r.e.) sets, which are sets that are generated by a computable function. These sets encode a degree of complexity within them. Specifically, the membership $$ x \in A $$ is a semi-recursive relation, which means if indeed, $$x$$ is in $$A$$, then we will know eventually, but if $$x \not\in A$$, we may have to wait forever to figure that out. An example is the set $$K = \{e \mid \phi_e(e)\downarrow\}$$ , where $$e \in K \iff$$ the $$e$$-th program, run on the input $$e$$, will halt.  If the program halts, then we can confidently say that $$e \in K$$, but otherwise we would need to wait forever. In automata theory, this is equivalent to saying that this set is **Turing-recognizable**.

The process of **reduction** is common in complexity theory and computability theory, as well as many other theoretical applications. Here, we say that $$A \leq_T B$$ if we can figure out membership of $$A$$ by a recursive program containing calls to membership of $$B$$ as an _oracle_. Along with Turing reducibility, there is also $m$-reducibility, $1$-reducibility, etc. Turing reducibility, however, to us theoretical computer scientists, make the most sense. This idea allows us to bridge relationships between sets using a computer program, say, written in C, and indeed, Turing reducibility is one of the hotter topics in modern computability due to its interesting structure.

This time, we will give an ambitious attempt to prove the famous **Post's Problem**, which asks if there are two r.e. sets that are not Turing reducible to each other. We will prove a weaker variant that does not require these sets to be r.e., and then introduce the concept of **finite injury priority argument** to solve it under computable conditions.
