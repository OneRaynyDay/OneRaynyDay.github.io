From the set of natural numbers, $$\mathbb{N}$$, we can generate a lot of subsets $$S \subset \mathbb{N}$$. In fact, the number of subsets we can have of $$\mathbb{N}$$ is so large that it's uncountable.

## Aside: $|P(\mathbb{N})| = \aleph_1$

We prove this by stating a more powerful claim: **there does not exist a bijection between a set and its powerset**. For set $$S = \emptyset$$ , it is trivial: $$|S| = 0 \neq |P(S)| = |\{\{\}\}| = 1$$ . So suppose it's non-empty, and it does have a bijection by contradiction, $$f : S \to P(S)$$. Then, we look at the following set,
$$
B = \{s \in S : s \not\in f(s)\} \subset S
$$
This is obviously a well constructed set $$B$$. It contains all elements $s$ such that the bijective mapping $f(s) = S \not\ni s$  , i.e. does not contain $s$ itself. There must exist a $$b \in S$$ such that $$f(b) = B$$ since to be bijective, $$f$$ must also be surjective(i.e. $$\forall X \in P(S), \exists x \in S, f(x) = X$$). Then, let's analyze two cases:

1. $$b \in B$$. Then by definition, $$b \in f(b) \implies b \not\in B$$. Contradiction.
2. $$b \not\in B$$. Then by definition, $$b \not\in f(b) \implies b \in B$$. Contradiction.

Both cases give us contradiction, then the bijection is absurd for any arbitrary set $$S$$. Furthermore, we can take the powerset of any uncountable set and reach a higher uncountable ordinal.

**This is important because although $$\mathbb{N}$$ may be countable, analyzing the subsets of $$\mathbb{N}$$ can prove to be much more complicated, and yields surprising results.**

# Semirecursive Relations

Before we dive in, we should revisit the *Halting Problem* as explored by the previous blog. For a given program, we want to know whether it terminates. Intuitively, we would be able to say "yes" eventually if the program does indeed terminate, but we would never be able to say "no", since it requires infinite time for us to wait before we answer. 

This is a **semirecursive relation**, asking "Would the program with code $$\hat{f}$$ halt on input $$x$$" a given program. To put it more formally,
$$
R(x) \iff f(x)\downarrow, \quad f\text{ is recursive}
$$

Additionally, it is equivalent to saying, "would there exist an output from the program?", which is:
$$
R(x) \iff \exists y P(x,y)
$$
Basically, semirecursive relations are ones that have a positive answer and may not have a decidable answer otherwise.

Some important closure properties of semirecursive relations:

1. **Disjunction:** $$ (\exists y) Q(x, y) \lor (\exists y)R(x,y) \iff (\exists u)[Q(x, u) \lor R(x,u)]$$  
2. **Conjunction:** $$ (\exists y)Q(x,y) \wedge (\exists y)R(x,y) \iff (\exists u)[Q(x,(u)_0) \wedge Q(x,(u)_1)]$$
3. **Existential Quantifiers:** $$(\exists z)(\exists y)Q(x,y,z) \iff (\exists u)[Q(x, (u)_0, (u)_1)]$$
4. **Bounded Universal Quantifiers**: $$(\forall i \leq z)(\exists y)Q(x,y,i) \iff (\exists u)[Q(x, (u)_i, i) \forall i \leq z]$$
5. **Recursive Characteristic Functions**: $$Q(x) \iff P(f_1(x),...,f_m(x))$$ 

However, note that it is **not closed under unbounded universal quantifiers**. Intuitively, if you had to make sure for every number, some relation is true, you'd have to run your program infinitely many times, without termination. Meanwhile, for a semirecursive relation, it must give us a positive answer in finite time. Consequently, it must also not be closed under **negation**, i.e.
$$
H(e,x) \iff (\exists y)T(e,x,y)
$$
is the halting relation, and $$\lnot H(e,x) \iff (\forall y)[\lnot T(e,x,y)]$$. 

# Recursive Sets

One way to analyze the high complexity of subsets on $$\mathbb{N}$$ is to see what kind of sets we can identify from algorithms. Recall the **Church-Turing thesis** states that algorithms and recursive partial functions are equivalent. By definition, a set $$A$$ is **recursive** if we can say "yes, $$x \in A$$" via a recursive function and "no, $$x \not\in A$$" similarly. Then, we can just ask from 0 onwards whether an element is in the set. For example,

Q: "Is 0 in A?", A: _runs some algorithm_... Yes

Q: "Is 1 in A?", A: _runs some algorithm_... No

Q: "Is 2 in A?", A: _runs some algorithm_... Yes

...

Then $$A = \{0,2,...\}$$ for this specific example.  

# Recursive Enumerable Sets

 then the definition is defined rigorously as the following:

**A set $$A \subset \mathbb{N}$$ is recursively enumerable (r.e.) if $$A = \emptyset$$ or $$A = \{f(0),f(1),f(2),f(3),...\}$$, where $$f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$$ is a total recursive function.**

We will prove some properties about them below:

1. **$$A$$ is r.e. $$\implies A = \{x \mid g(x)\downarrow\}$$ .** What this means is that $$A$$ is the domain of some partial recursive function $$g$$. We know $$A$$ is the enumeration of $$f$$, then $$\forall x, \exists y, T(\hat{f}, x, y)$$ by Kleene's Normal Form theorem. Then, we define the partial $$g(y) := \mu_z [ T(\hat{f}, (z)_0, (z)_1) \& U((z)_1) = y] $$. By definition, $$g$$ will only converge on some $$y$$ if it is the result of some computation where the input is $$(z)_0$$, and the output computation state is $$(z)_1$$. We solved for both unknowns using Godel coding to dovetail.
2. **We can further allow $$f$$ to be injective if $$A$$ is infinite.** We define $$B = \{ z \in \mathbb{N} \mid T(\hat{f}, (z)_0, (z)_1) \& \forall n < z,[T(\hat{f}, (n)_0, (n)_1) \implies (z)_1 \neq (n)_1]]\}$$. This set $$B$$ is a set that contains all inputs and outputs of $$f$$ such that the output cannot be the same for two different inputs, i.e. the definition of injection. $$B$$ is recursively enumerated by some recursive total function $$g$$, since it is clear that we can write a function that asks for $$\mu_z$$ of that giant predicate describing the set, then simply define $$\bar{f}(n) = (g(n))_1$$ then $$\bar{f}$$ enumerates the outputs of the original function $$f$$ injectively.
3. **The relation $$x \in A$$ is semirecursive**. This is true since $$x \in A \iff \exists n [ f(n) = x ]$$.  Since $$f$$ is recursive, this is by definition a semirecursive relation. This has some implications. Given $$A,B$$ recursive enumerable, 
   1. $$A \cup B$$ is also r.e.
   2. $$A \cap B$$ is also r.e.
   3. $$A^c$$ is not r.e.
   4.  $$f[A]$$, and $$f^{-1}[A]$$, i.e. the image and inverse image of $$A$$ under $$f$$ is r.e.

For sake of brevity, I'll list out a few properties without proofs (which can be found online):

1. A set is recursive iff it can be enumerated by a total, monotonically increasing $$f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$$ .
2. **The halting set** defined as $$H' = \{x \mid H((x)_0, (x)_1\}$$ *is recursive enumerable, but not recursive*. Recall $$H(e,x)$$ is true if the partial function coded by $$e$$,taking in the input $$x$$, converges, i.e. $$\phi_e(x) \downarrow$$. (Think about what it would imply if $$H$$ was recursive)
3. **Post's Diagonal** is defined as $$K = \{x \mid \phi_x(x) \downarrow\}â€‹$$. This is slightly more elegant than the halting set, but it is also recursive enumerable but not recursive.

# Reductions and r.e. completeness

In algorithms courses offered in CS, where one briefly visits the NP class of problems, the topic of **NP complete** problems show up. An NP complete problem is one which every other problem in NP can be reduced to. What is reduction? It means that we can use another problem in order to solve this problem. A quick example is, we can reduce the problem of Clique to a problem of Independent Set by inverting the edge set of the input graph, and if independent set returns some $K$, then we have a $K$ clique in our graph. Recall we cannot increase our input size exponentially or call the reduction exponential number of times, for it to be a reduction in that sense.

What does reductions and r.e. complete mean then? Well, basically the same, but applied to r.e. sets. Formally, a **reduction** from a set $$A$$ to $$B$$ is such that we can ask questions about membership in $$B$$ to determine membership in $$A$$. There is a hierarchy of "ease" of reduction by the following classifications:

1. The reduction is $$A \leq_T B \iff \mathcal{X}_A \in \mathcal{R}(\textbf{N}_0, \mathcal{X}_B)$$. In other words, the characteristic function of $$x \in A$$ can be composed as a recursive (total) function which includes $$\mathcal{X}_B, S, Pd$$ on $$\mathbb{N}$$.  We call this **Turing reducibility**.
2. The reduction is $$A \leq_m B \iff [x \in A \iff f(x) \in B]$$ if $$f$$ is arbitrary.
3. The reduction is $$A \leq_1 B$$ if $$f$$ in 2) is injective. 
4. The reduction is $$A \equiv B$$ if $$f$$ in 2) is bijective.
