Hi! If you happened to chance upon my blog, there is a high probability that you will be interested in
one of the topics that I dabble in. I'm by no means an expert at any of them, but
I do aim to illustrate the concepts that I _do_ know in a _clear, digestible, and hopefully fun way_.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at UCLA studying computer science. I'm a huge math geek and I take
too many math classes for fun. I used to do fun research with Professor Talwalkar and his PhD student Liam Li,
but they've since moved to CMU and I haven't been able to find something as interesting since. :(

Most of the time, I write on this blog because I'm too lazy to take on some huge project and just want to
chill and learn some fun stuff that's probably not useful.

I'm currently doing an internship for Citadel LLC, and I am going to work at Airbnb during the summer,
working on ML.

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don't hesitate to shoot me a message at rayzhang@g.ucla.edu.
