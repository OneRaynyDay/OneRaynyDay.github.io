Hi! If you happened to chance upon my blog, there is a high probability that you will be interested in
one of the topics that I dabble in. I'm by no means an expert at any of the fields that I enumerated, but
I do aim to illustrate the concepts that I _do_ know in a clear, digestible, and hopefully fun way.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at UCLA studying computer science. I'm a huge math geek and I take
too many math classes for fun. I used to do fun research with Professor Talwalkar and his PhD student Liam Li,
but they've since moved to CMU and I haven't been able to find something as interesting since :(

I'm currently doing an internship for Citadel LLC, and I am going to work at Airbnb during the summer,
working on a (currently secret) ML project. When it comes out, I'll write something about it ;)

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don't hesitate to shoot me a message at rayzhang@g.ucla.edu.
