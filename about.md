Hi! If you happened to chance upon my blog, there is a high probability that you will be interested in
one of the topics that I dabble in. I'm by no means an expert at any of them, but
I do aim to illustrate the concepts that I _do_ know in a _clear, digestible, and hopefully fun way_.

I graduated from UCLA as a computer science major. I'm a huge math geek and I take
too many math classes for fun. My interests span from theoretical mathematics to machine learning to learning about the linux kernel.
On my day job, I work with Kubernetes, open source libraries and the general AWS stack. I'm on the Machine Learning Infrastructure team
at Airbnb and we're working on some exciting things - some of which may be opensourced soon!
One day, I hope to go back to graduate school and do research on subjects I'm interested in.

Most of the time, I write on this blog because I'm too lazy to take on some huge project and just want to
chill and learn some fun stuff that's sometimes not useful.

I previously interned at some companies including Airbnb, Citadel, Bloomberg and Symantec, so I have had a sizeable amount of time working
on teams that focus on scientific computing and performance.

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don't hesitate to shoot me a message at rayzhang@g.ucla.edu. I'm just a human, 
so I make typos!

Oh - and one more thing. Here's [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oneraynyday/) if you're planning to give me boatloads of money.
